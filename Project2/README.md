# How to Run

Emulator [emu8086](https://download.cnet.com/Emu8086-Microprocessor-Emulator/3000-2069_4-10392690.html) was used for this project to test the source code. Open `TETRIS.asm` using this emulator and click *compile* to generate `TETRIS.com` file.

Then you will need [DOSBOX](https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1) to execute this file.

After installing DOSBOX, open it and type `mount C C:\path\to\your\file.asm` to switch to you folder. Now you can run the game using these commands:

 1. `C:`
 2. `TETRIS.com` 

Note: The score of the game is aslo displayed in a LED which you are not able to see it in Dosbox.
